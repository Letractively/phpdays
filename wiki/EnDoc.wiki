You can help us to improve the documentation, fix errors in it, and translate it into other languages.

=== Translating the Documentation ===

To translate the documentation into other languages you should know the following:
 * page names start with a language name abbreviation _(Ru for Russian, En for English, Fr for French)_
 * go to the page you would like to translate _(for example [RuAnswers])_
 * click "Edit this page" at the top of the page to see the page in the wiki format
 * copy the content of the page in the original language
 * point your browser to a translated page by changing the language prefix in the name of the page _(for example, if you opened RuAnswers and are going to translate it to English, change the name to EnAnswers)_
 * if the page does not exist, you will be offered to create it _(click the "Create a New Page" link)_
 * paste the copied content in the original language
 * translate the text from the original language
 * at the top of the text edit the title of the page in the `#summary` line
 * add/edit a `#sidebar Xx` line  _(where Xx is the language of the newly translated page)_
 * click "Preview" to check the page's formatting
 * click "Save page" to save the page
