To improve the existing base of applications _(located in `apps` directory)_ do the following:
 * create a new empty project _(in the `/var/www/` directory)_
 * checkout the project from SVN _(use the path to this project, for example: `https://phpdays.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/apps/phpdays.org`)_
 * configure the project, but do not commit configuration files to SVN
