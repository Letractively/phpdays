 * also you will be added to [http://code.google.com/p/phpdays/people/list the project's member list] _(don't forget to add this link to your resume)_

=== General Information about the Site ===

 * [http://code.google.com/p/phpdays/downloads/list Downloads] - Download page, where the project's working copies are available, intended for the end user

=== Guidelines for Applying Changes _(SVN commit)_ ===

For comments follow the format listed below

 * `Fix #1234: The name of the bug` - for a fix of the error number `1234`. If the bug is not in the [http://code.google.com/p/phpdays/issues/list Issues], then you should add the issue first and only then make a `SVN commit`
 * write each bug/issue in a separate line. Put a dot at the end of line.

=== Test Yourself ===

Set up [http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/recent_improvements_in_phpunit_support PHPUnit]. This will allow you to create unit tests to ensure that a new fix in code will not break something else. Only after this should you run `SVN commit`.

=== Write Better Code ===

Read about the [EnCodingStyle coding style] adopted in our project. Following uniform style allows all developers to communicate in a single, comprehensible language.
